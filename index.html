  <h2>Story</h2>
  <p>
	Demon Slayer is a Japanese anime set in Taisho-era Japan, where demons roam the night and 	prey on humans. The story follows Tanjiro Kamado, a kind-hearted boy who lives peacefully 	with his family. One tragic day, Tanjiro returns home to find his family slaughtered by 	demons. The only survivor is his younger sister Nezuko, who has been turned into a demon 	herself.

	Unlike other demons, Nezuko still shows human emotions and protects her brother. 	Determined to save her, Tanjiro joins the Demon Slayer Corps, an organization dedicated 	to hunting demons and protecting humanity. He trains relentlessly, learning powerful 	sword techniques called Breathing Styles.

	Throughout his journey, Tanjiro battles terrifying demons, makes loyal friends, and faces 	painful choices. His goal remains clear: defeat the demon king Muzan Kibutsuji and find a 	cure for Nezuko. Demon Slayer is a story of family, perseverance, and compassion, showing 	that even in darkness, kindness can still survive.
